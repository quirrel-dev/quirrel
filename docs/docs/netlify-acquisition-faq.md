## How long will I have access to quirrel.dev?

Current Quirrel customers on Free or Pro plans will have access to Quirrel through the end of July 2022.
Quirrel is no longer accepting new customers.
If you have an existing account, you will be able to continue to log into your account through July 31, 2022.

## When should I expect billing from Quirrel to end?

All paying Quirrel customers will continue to be billed at their existing rate until the service terminates on August 1.
Even if you continue using Quirrel until August 1, you will not be charged after your last bill in July.
If you so choose, you may also close your account at any time, and we will waive the charges since your previous bill.

## What should I use instead of Quirrel?

You're invited to try Netlify’s latest Scheduled Functions release in Netlify Labs.
If you’re already hosting your site on Netlify, it’s [as easy as adding a few lines to your existing functions or `netlify.toml`](https://ntl.fyi/sched-func).
And if you haven’t had a chance to use Netlify yet, even if you’re hosting your website somewhere else, Netlify Functions is a fantastic way to host (and now schedule!) your serverless functions.

If you’re using some of Quirrel’s more advanced features that we don’t yet support on Netlify, you may also choose to [deploy Quirrel in your own infrastructure](https://docs.quirrel.dev/deployment/connecting), or use a service like [Zeplo](https://www.zeplo.io).

## I have more questions! How can I get in touch?

If you have any questions about Quirrel, feel free to reach out to Simon directly via Twitter DM to @skn0tt.
For questions about Netlify Scheduled Functions, we encourage you to post on the [Netlify Forums](https://answers.netlify.com/c/features/50).

## What’s happening to the open-source Quirrel projects?

Simon will continue maintaining the open source Quirrel project until July 2022.
We will have more to share about open source maintenance later this year.
