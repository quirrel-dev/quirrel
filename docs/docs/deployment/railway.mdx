# Railway

To deploy your own Quirrel server to Railway, click this button:

[![Deploy to Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/quirrel)

During the process, Railway will clone this repository for you. In there, you find a `Dockerfile`. To pin down your Quirrel version, update its tag:

```diff
- FROM ghcr.io/quirrel-dev/quirrel:main
+ FROM ghcr.io/quirrel-dev/quirrel:sha-f218c98
```

Check Quirrel's [Docker image page](https://github.com/quirrel-dev/quirrel/pkgs/container/quirrel) to find the exact version you want to pin.

Use the `PASSPHRASES` you set during the creation to issue a new token:

```sh
curl --user ignored:<PASSPHRASES> -X PUT https://mighty-owl-production.up.railway.app/tokens/foo
```

Reference doc: [Acquire a token](/deployment/connecting#acquire-a-token)

Token api source code: [src/api/scheduler/routes/tokens.ts](https://github.com/quirrel-dev/quirrel/blob/main/src/api/scheduler/routes/tokens.ts)

You now have your own Quirrel instance ðŸ¥³

Next step: [Connecting your application](/deployment/connecting).
